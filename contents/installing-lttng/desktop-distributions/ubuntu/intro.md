The following steps apply to Ubuntu&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;12.04. For
previous releases, you need to build and install LTTng
[from source](#doc-building-from-source), as no Ubuntu packages were
available before version 12.04.

Two repository types can provide LTTng packages for Ubuntu: official
repositories and <abbr title="Personal Package Archive">PPA</abbr>.
