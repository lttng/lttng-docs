Welcome to the **LTTng Documentation**!

The _Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation_ is an open source software
toolkit which you can use to simultaneously trace the Linux kernel, user
applications, and user libraries.

LTTng consists of:

* Kernel modules to trace the Linux kernel.
* Shared libraries to trace user applications written in C or C++.
* Java packages to trace Java applications which use `java.util.logging`
  or Apache log4j 1.2.
* A Python package to trace Python applications which use the standard
  `logging` package.
* A kernel module to trace shell scripts and other user applications
  without a dedicated instrumentation mechanism.
* Daemons and a command-line tool, cmd:lttng, to control the
  LTTng tracers.
