A few people made the online LTTng Documentation possible.

http://eepp.ca/[Philippe Proulx] wrote most of the content, created
the diagrams, and formatted the document. He's the current maintainer
of the LTTng Documentation.

Daniel U. Thibault, from the DRDC, wrote
``http://cradpdf.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/PDFS/unc246/p804561_A1b.pdf[LTTng: The
Linux Trace Toolkit Next Generation{nbsp}&#8212;{nbsp}A Comprehensive
User's Guide (version 2.3 edition)]'' which was used to complete parts
of the ``<<core-concepts,Core concepts>>'' and ``<<plumbing,Components
of LTTng>>'' sections and for a few passages here and there.

The entire http://www.efficios.com/[EfficiOS] team made essential reviews
of the whole document.

We sincerely thank everyone who helped enhance the quality of this
documentation.
